## Deployment
### As a dApp developer I want to be able to deploy my rholang contract to a validator
#### A correct contract gets deployed successfully
##### test: not available
##### steps:

* instantiate p2p network with single `ceremonyMaster` that transitions to `ApprovedBlockReceivedhandler` (`--required-sig 0`)
* call `rnode deploy` with `rholang/examples/tut-philosophers.rho` on `ceremonyMaster`

##### test: test/test_storage.py::test_data_is_stored_and_served_by_node

* assert success on std out
* call `rnode deploy` & `rnode propose` with `integration-tests/features/contracts/storage/read-data.rho` on `ceremonyMaster`
* assert success on std out
* compare data sent and restored


### As a user I want to know how much REV my deployment will cost
## REV
### As a platform stakeholder, I want REV to be the currency token for the RChain platform
### As a REV holder, assuming I maintain control of my keys and properly use the wallet where I store REV, I expect my REV to never be lost
## Wallets
### As a user, I want to be able to configure a coop-supplied wallet so that I can store REV in it
### As a user, I want to be able to interface with the coop-supplied wallet at the command line.
### As a user, I want to be able to add REV to my coop-supplied wallet so that I have available REV to pay for goods/services
### As a user, I want to be able to remove REV from my coop-supplied wallet so that I can pay for goods/services
### As a user, I want to be able to receive REV from another user by providing that user with the public key for my coop-supplied-wallet.
### As a user, I want to be able to send REV to the coop-supplied wallet of another user by specifying the public key to the coop-supplied wallet of that user.
### As a user of a coop-supplied wallet, I want to query a wallet contract (or the blocks) for my public address to get the history of all REV transfers to and/or from it
### As a recipient of REV (other than REV at mainnet launch 'genesis'), I can use a co-op supplied dApp to view my REV balance
### As a recipient of REV at mainnet launch 'genesis', I can use a co-op supplied wallet to view my REV balance after launch.
### As an organization holding REV, I need to have multiple approviesr for any REV transaction.
### As a validator, I can move Rev to/from the key-pair for one validator node to the key-pair for another validator node or that of the co-op supplied wallet dApp
### As a wallet dApp developer, I want to use Ethereum-style addresses for send transactions to specify the recipient, so that a) I can reuse available Ethereum utility libraries; b) so the QR code is smaller and thus faster to scan than it would be for a full public key; c) it is easier for users to verbally confirm their address versus public key; and d) so RChain is more palatable for the Ethereum community
### As a wallet dApp developer, I want to discover and connect to rNodes that support a particular version (release number and hash) and have a minimum number of active connections, so that user risks due to interoperability issues and sybil actors are minimized
### As a wallet user, I need a command line interface for interacting with wallets.
### As a dApp organization, I need to have multiple approvers for any send transaction.
## Validation
### As a RChain validator, I want my validator identity to be different from the identity of my node and from the identity of my wallet
#### TBD
##### documentation: TBD
### As a RChain validator, I want to know when a block I propose is finalized and with what degree of confidence
#### TBD
##### test: TBD
##### steps:

* run p2p network
* duplicate steps in CliqueOracleTest to get get a DAG of known shape
* run show-block on each block and assert known fault tolerance

### As a RChain validator, I want to expose to the internet only those methods needed for production dApps
## Bonding/Unbonding
### As a Node Validator, I want to be able to add my stake to the network and be recognized as a validator so I can participate in proof of stake consensus and be eligible to earn rewards (validating)
#### Bonding a validator
##### test: test/test_heterogenous_validators.py::test_heterogenous_validators
##### steps:

* TBD

### As a Node Validator, I want to be able to retrieve my stake from the network and no longer be recognized a as validator
### As an incoming Node Validator, I need confirmation of my request to bond
### As a platform stakeholder, I want to know only bonded validators are able to propose
#### TBD
##### documentation
## Consensus
### As a Node Validator, who joins existing network, my node can catch up and finalize the same set of blocks that other nodes are finalizing
#### Catch up triggerd by next round from other validator
##### test: TBD
##### steps:

* initiate p2p with 3 validators `validatorA`, `validatorB`, `validatorC`
* each validator runs 100 rounds of deploy and propose
* wait graceful period of 30 seconds
* validator `validatorD` joins the network
* `validatorA` runs deploy and propose
* wait graceful period of 30 seconds
* each validator should have a DAG with same set of finalized blocks

#### Catch up automatically
##### test: TBD
##### steps:

* initiate p2p with 3 validators `validatorA`, `validatorB`, `validatorC`
* each validator runs 10 rounds of deploy and propose
* wait graceful period of 30 seconds
* validator `validatorD` joins the network
* wait graceful period of 10 seconds
* each validator should have a DAG with same set of finalized blocks

### As a Node Validator I want consensus protocol to converge
#### 5 validators deploying 200 blocks end up with the same DAG
##### test: test/test_consensus.py::test_5val_200blocks
##### steps:

* initiate p2p with 5 validators `validatorA`, `validatorB`, `validatorC`, `validatorD` and `validatorE`
* each validator runs 200 rounds of deploy and propose
* wait graceful period of 30 seconds
* each validator should output exactly same DAG
